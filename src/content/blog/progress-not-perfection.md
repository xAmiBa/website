## REASON 1: Embracing Every Step of the Journey

Our brains have a peculiar way of workingâ€”traumatic experiences stick like glue, but the victories, big and small, tend to slip away unnoticed. Ever recall spending three agonizing days wrestling with a multi-layered-well-hidden-with-loads-of-dependencies bug? Absolutely. Now, what about the exhilaration of scripting your first for loop with a "hello world" print statement? Perhaps a faint memory. By tracking our progress, we consciously store not only the struggles but also the triumphs, ensuring a more balanced and encouraging perspective on our coding journey.

## REASON 2: Your Personal Motivational Boost

In the world of programming, constant learning is the name of the game. Unfortunately, we can't expect people around us to constantly pat our backs every time we are fed up or demotivated. Instead, imagine having a reservoir of motivation at your fingertips. When frustration or weariness sets in, a glance at your progress list acts as a powerful reminder. The extensive list speaks volumes about your journey, reinforcing that every stumbling block is just a small part of the vast landscape you've painted. It's your internal cheerleader, propelling you forward with a renewed sense of accomplishment and determination.

## REASON 3: It's Your Secret Weapon in Job Interviews!

Imagine this: You embarked on your coding journey, starting with Code First Girls and Codecademy courses, progressing to freeCodeCamp or maybe signing up for a coding bootcamp like Makers. Fast forward a year, and your portfolio is polished, but here's the catchâ€”memories of the challenges you conquered along the way start to fade. You're about to walk into a job interview, and recalling those invaluable stories that showcase your resilience and self-motivation becomes a challenge. Enter your progress trackerâ€”the unsung hero. It not only serves as a testament to your growth but also unfolds a vivid narrative of your coding evolution. With each entry, you rediscover the battles you fought, the problems you solved, and the triumphs that shaped you into the determined coder sitting in that interview room. It's not just a list; it's your story, ready to impress and inspire.

### Bonus: Your Personalized Progress Tracker on Notion :)

Imagine a progress tracker designed with your coding journey in mind. That's exactly what I've created for you. This Notion-powered tool goes beyond traditional tracking by offering a personalized, interactive experience.

With a simple click, you can effortlessly add new skills, capture your experiences, and celebrate both small victories and major milestones. Notion automatically timestamps each entry, providing a clear view of your coding evolution. I find if useful to rate my confidence levels and observe the progress graph over time so I added this feature as well.
